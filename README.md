# WebTerminal

WebTerminal is a web-based terminal implementation that acts as my personal website. It is accompanied by a standard website view.

## Terminal

Interact with the terminal over the web. Type 'help' for possible commands.

Explore the 'fun' directory for secrets.

Explore the 'website' directory to view the personal website content via command line.

## Web view

The personal website content is also viewable in a standard website format.

## Code

Web site built with HTML/JS/CSS. Web server logic built with C Sharp .NET.

## Credits

The web-based terminal project was inspired by Google's foobar recruiting tool: https://www.google.com/foobar. Some CSS was used and credited in the source code (i.e. cursor blink animation and custom scroll bar).

Otherwise built by Ryan Allen.
